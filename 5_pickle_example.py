# Python pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Any object in Python can be pickled
# so that it can be saved on disk. What pickle does is that it “serializes” the object first before writing it to file.
# Pickling is a way to convert a python object (list, dict, etc.) into a character stream. The idea is that this character
# stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another python script.
